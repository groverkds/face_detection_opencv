# face_detection_opencv
Face detection using opencv's “hidden” deep learning-based face detector.

This module uses the dnn module of opencv. Primary contributor for rhe dnn module is Aleksandr Rybnikov (https://github.com/arrybn). Also, thanks to Adrian Rosebrock(www.pyimagesearch.com) for an awesome tutorial which enabled me to write this code. I am including the prototext file and caffe model for the same, which again is, provided by Adrian Rosebrock. Check out his tutorial: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/.

Steps to run:

    install opencv (version >= 3.3) (pip3 install opencv-python)
    install numpy (pip3 install numpy)
    run main.py
